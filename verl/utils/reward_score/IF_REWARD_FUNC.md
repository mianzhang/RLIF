## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive documentation for instruction following evaluation in VERL using IFBench and IFEval frameworks. The implementation enables automated evaluation of whether model responses follow specific instructions during reinforcement learning training, providing detailed metrics for both prompt-level and instruction-level performance.

The instruction following reward scoring modules (`ifbench.py` and `ifeval.py`) evaluate whether model responses follow specific instructions and integrate seamlessly with VERL's reward scoring system to provide automated evaluation of instruction adherence during reinforcement learning training.

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

```python
from verl.utils.reward_score import default_compute_score

# For IFBench
ground_truth_ifbench = {
    "instruction_ids": ["count:word_count_range"],
    "kwargs": [{"min_words": 10, "max_words": 20}],
    "prompt": "Write a short story."
}

response = "Once upon a time there was a brave knight who saved the princess."
score = default_compute_score("ifbench", response, ground_truth_ifbench)
print(score)  # {'score': 1.0, 'acc': True, 'follow_all_instructions': True, ...}

# For IFEval
ground_truth_ifeval = {
    "instruction_ids": ["length_constraints:number_words"],
    "kwargs": [{"num_words": 15, "relation": "at least"}],
    "prompt": "Explain machine learning."
}

response = "Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data."
score = default_compute_score("ifeval", response, ground_truth_ifeval)
print(score)  # {'score': 1.0, 'acc': True, 'follow_all_instructions': True, ...}
```

### Direct Module Usage

```python
from verl.utils.reward_score import ifbench, ifeval

# Direct IFBench usage
result = ifbench.compute_score(response, ground_truth, strict=True)

# Direct IFEval usage  
result = ifeval.compute_score(response, ground_truth, strict=False)  # loose evaluation
```

### Ground Truth Format

The ground truth should be a dictionary (or JSON string) containing:

- `instruction_ids`: List of instruction identifiers to check
- `kwargs`: List of dictionaries containing parameters for each instruction
- `prompt`: (Optional) The original prompt text

Example:
```python
ground_truth = {
    "instruction_ids": ["count:word_count_range", "format:title_case"],
    "kwargs": [
        {"min_words": 50, "max_words": 100},
        {}
    ],
    "prompt": "Write a title-cased essay about AI."
}
```

### Return Format

All scoring functions return a dictionary containing:

```python
{
    "score": 1.0,  # Binary: 1.0 for success, 0.0 for failure
    "acc": True,   # Boolean success indicator
    "follow_all_instructions": True,
    "follow_instruction_list": [True, True],  # Per-instruction results
    "num_instructions": 2,
    "num_followed": 2,
    "accuracy": 1.0,  # Ratio of followed instructions
    "evaluation_mode": "strict",
    "instruction_ids": ["count:word_count_range", "format:title_case"]
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### How It Works

#### Data Flow
1. **Input**: Model response + ground truth containing instruction IDs and parameters
2. **Processing**: 
   - Parse ground truth (JSON string or dict)
   - Load appropriate evaluation framework (IFBench or IFEval)
   - Create mock input objects compatible with the original evaluation code
   - Run instruction checking using the original evaluation logic
3. **Output**: Comprehensive score dictionary with binary success/failure and detailed metrics

### Key Features

#### 1. **Automatic Path Discovery**
- Both modules automatically locate IFBench and IFEval evaluation code in the `RLIF_data` directory
- No manual path configuration required
- Robust search algorithm that traverses the directory tree

#### 2. **Dual Evaluation Modes**
- **Strict Mode**: Evaluates response exactly as provided
- **Loose Mode**: Tries multiple variations (removes first/last lines, asterisks, etc.)
- Configurable via function parameters

#### 3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Graceful handling of missing dependencies
- Proper error reporting in return values
- Fallback behaviors for edge cases
- No crashes on malformed input

#### 4. **VERL Integration**
- Follows VERL's reward scoring patterns
- Compatible with existing training pipelines
- Returns standardized score dictionaries
- Supports both dictionary and JSON string ground truth

#### 5. **Detailed Metrics**
- Per-instruction evaluation results
- Overall success rates
- Accuracy calculations
- Debugging information

### Evaluation Modes

#### Strict Mode (default)
- Evaluates the response exactly as provided
- More stringent evaluation

#### Loose Mode
- Tries multiple variations of the response (removing first/last lines, asterisks, etc.)
- More lenient evaluation that accounts for common formatting variations

## Data Preparation

The implementation works with data transformed by the provided scripts:

```bash
# Transform test data
python RLIF_data/create_verl_test_data.py --ifbench_file path/to/ifbench_test.jsonl --ifeval_file path/to/ifeval_test.jsonl

# Transform training data  
python RLIF_data/create_verl_train_data.py --input_file path/to/training_data.jsonl
```

These scripts convert IFBench and IFEval data to VERL-compatible format with proper ground truth structure.

## Integration with VERL

The reward scoring functions integrate seamlessly with VERL's training pipeline. Simply specify the appropriate data source in your training configuration:

```yaml
# For IFBench data
data:
  data_source_key: "data_source"  # Should contain "ifbench"
  
# For IFEval data  
data:
  data_source_key: "data_source"  # Should contain "ifeval"
```

The implementation is ready for use. To get started:

1. Ensure IFBench and IFEval dependencies are installed
2. Use the data transformation scripts to prepare your data
3. Configure your VERL training with `data_source: "ifbench"` or `data_source: "ifeval"`
4. Run training - the reward scoring will automatically use the appropriate evaluation framework

The modules will automatically handle the instruction following evaluation and provide detailed feedback to guide the reinforcement learning process.

## Dependencies

### Required for Full Functionality
- **IFBench dependencies**: `nltk`, `spacy`, `emoji`, `syllapy`, etc.
- **IFEval dependencies**: `langdetect`, `absl-py`, etc.
- **VERL dependencies**: Standard VERL installation

### Graceful Degradation
- Modules handle missing dependencies gracefully

## Performance Analysis

### Key Findings

#### 1. **Model Performance Comparison**
- **IFEval model performs significantly better** (77.1% vs 26.2% strict accuracy)
- The GPT-4 model used for IFEval responses shows better instruction following capabilities
- IFBench appears to have more challenging or complex instructions

#### 2. **Instruction Type Analysis**

**Easy Instructions** (High Success Rate):
- Simple content detection (placeholders, postscripts)
- Basic formatting (JSON, titles)
- Content existence checks
- Person/pronoun counting

**Difficult Instructions** (Low Success Rate):
- Multiple keyword requirements with specific frequencies
- Complex word count constraints
- Advanced formatting requirements
- Custom logic-based instructions

#### 3. **Strict vs Loose Evaluation**
- **IFBench**: Loose evaluation provides minimal improvement (29.9% vs 26.2%)
- **IFEval**: Loose evaluation shows modest improvement (79.9% vs 77.1%)
- Suggests that most failures are fundamental rather than formatting issues

#### 4. **Instruction-Level Insights**

**IFBench Challenges**:
- `count:keywords_multiple` is the most common but has 0% success rate
- Complex custom instructions consistently fail
- Word manipulation tasks are particularly difficult

**IFEval Strengths**:
- Strong performance on format-based instructions
- Good handling of content detection tasks
- Reasonable performance on language constraints

## Recommendations

### For Model Improvement:
1. **Focus on keyword frequency tasks** - major weakness in current models
2. **Improve complex formatting adherence** - custom instructions need attention
3. **Enhance word-level manipulation** - palindromes, alphabetical ordering, etc.

### For Evaluation:
1. **Use IFEval for baseline comparisons** - more reliable evaluation
2. **Consider IFBench for challenging instruction following** - harder benchmark
3. **Monitor both strict and loose metrics** - understand failure modes

### Benefits

1. **Seamless Integration**: Works directly with existing VERL training pipelines
2. **Robust Evaluation**: Uses the original IFBench and IFEval evaluation logic
3. **Flexible Configuration**: Supports both strict and loose evaluation modes
4. **Comprehensive Metrics**: Provides detailed evaluation information for analysis
